The notification features the Jam Deck icon (a pink jar) and displays 'Server Started' as the header, followed by the message 'Now playing overlay is active!' The notification uses the standard macOS rounded rectangle design with a light gray background.](/assets/images/jam-deck-macos-notification.png)

### Menu Bar App

Jam Deck's menu bar app provides easy access to all features directly from your Mac's menu bar:

1. **Server Control**
   - Click "Start Server" to begin displaying your music.
   - Click "Stop Server" when you're done streaming.

2. **Scene Management**
   - Under "Copy Scene URL," select any scene to copy its URL to the clipboard.
   - Each scene can have unique theme and width settings.
   - Use "Add New Scene..." to create custom scenes for different parts of your stream.
   - Use "Manage Scenes..." to rename or delete existing scenes.

3. **Browser Integration**
   - Click "Open in Browser" to preview how the default overlay looks.

## Setting Up OBS

To add Jam Deck to your OBS scene:

1. In OBS Studio, select the scene where you want to display your music.
2. In the Sources panel, click the `+` button.
3. Select `Browser` from the list of sources.
4. Choose `Create New` and give it a name (e.g., "Now Playing Music").
5. Click `OK`.
6. In the Browser Source properties:
   - URL: Use the app to copy a scene-specific URL. The default URL is `http://localhost:8080/`
   - Width: 400 (recommended minimum)
   - Height: 140
   - Check "Refresh browser when scene becomes active."
7. Click `OK` to add the browser source.

### Theme Selection

Hover over the overlay (right-click -> Inspect) to reveal the settings menu:

#### Rounded Themes
- **Natural** (default): Soft green theme with rounded corners.
- **Twitch**: Dark purple theme that matches Twitch aesthetics.
- **Dark**: Sleek black theme with cyan accents.
- **Pink**: Vibrant pink theme with friendly typography.
- **Light**: Clean white theme with blue accents.

#### Square Themes
- **Transparent**: Minimalist theme with no background, just text and artwork.
- **Neon**: Cyberpunk-inspired theme with glowing cyan text on black background.
- **Terminal**: Green-on-black theme reminiscent of classic computer terminals.
- **Retro**: Blue and yellow theme using pixel-style Press Start 2P font.
- **High Contrast**: Black and white theme with Atkinson Hyperlegible font optimized for maximum readability.

**Note about Settings Storage**: Theme and width preferences are stored separately in each browser's local storage. This means settings selected in your regular browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) won't automatically appear in OBS. You'll need to configure your preferred settings once in each environment where you use Jam Deck.

### Width Options

In the settings menu:

- **A**: Adaptive width (only as wide as needed for the text).
- **F**: Fixed width (expands to fill the entire browser source width, default).

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>No music information appears</summary>

- Make sure the server is running.
- Make sure Apple Music is running.
- Try playing/pausing music to trigger an update.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Permission errors</summary>

- macOS may need permission to control Apple Music.
- Go to System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Automation.
- Ensure "Jam Deck" has permission to control Apple Music.
- If you see a permissions prompt when launching the app, click "OK" to allow access.

</details>

## Auto-Start on Boot

<details>
<summary>Using the Menu Bar App</summary>

If you're using the menu bar app (Option 1 installation):

1. Go to System Preferences → Users & Groups → Login Items.
2. Click the "+" button.
3. Browse to your Applications folder and select "Jam Deck.app"
4. The app will now start automatically at login.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Using the Manual Installation</summary>

If you're using the manual installation:

1. Create an Automator application:
   - Open Automator.
   - Create a new Application.
   - Add a "Run Shell Script" action.
   - Enter: `cd /path/to/jam-deck && ./music_server.py`
   - Save as "Start Jam Deck"

2. Add to Login Items:

   - Add the Automator application you created.

</details>

## Customization

Advanced users can modify the CSS in `overlay.css` to create custom themes or change the layout.

### Changing the Port

The server automatically starts on port 8080. If this port is already in use, it will automatically find and use the next available port. The selected port will be displayed in the menu bar app and system notifications.

If you need to manually specify a different port (Manual installation only):

1. Open `music_server.py` in a text editor.
2. Find the line near the top that says `PORT = 8080`
3. Change `8080` to your desired port number.
4. Save the file and restart the server.
5. Update your browser source URL in OBS to use the new port.

## Building from Source

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.6 or later
- macOS 10.14 or later
- create-dmg (optional, for creating DMG installers)

If you want to build the Jam Deck menu bar app from source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jam-deck.git
   cd jam-deck
   ```

2. Install py2app:
   ```
   pip install py2app
   ```

3. Option A - Using the build script (recommended):
   ```
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ```
   
   Option B - Manual build:
   ```
   python setup.py py2app
   ```

4. The built application will be available in the `dist` directory.

### Build Scripts

- `build.sh`: Automated build script that handles closing any running instances, cleaning previous builds, building the app, and creating a DMG installer.
- `setup.py`: Main build configuration for py2app.
- `collect_zmq.py`: Helper script to ensure ZeroMQ libraries are properly included in the build.

### Script Permissions

Ensure that your build script has execute permissions. You can set this by running `chmod +x build.sh` in the terminal.

### Environment Considerations

Make sure that the necessary tools (osascript, rm, python, create-dmg) are installed and accessible in your system's PATH. The create-dmg tool is only needed if you want to create DMG installers.
